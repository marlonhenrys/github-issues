I was again logged into someone else's account (a different user this time).
Out of curiosity, I had to try deleting this user account as well (sorry!), and when I logged back in again with Github, I was signed in as a different user again. I assume these were all real accounts because they had different user profile pics and such.

freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,11,Grab larger Twitter image?,"The new bio's page needs a larger image than is currently being pulled during sign-up with Twitter. Right now, the default image is blurry. Not sure if this is also happening with other authorization methods. It is an easy fix by changing it on the form, but I'm assuming this could be a easier user experience.
For example, the image from my original Twitter sign-up pulled this image ""normal"" image:
https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/539515557184167936/JqJXzV9x_normal.jpeg

The workaround for this is to offer a direct link to the YouTube videos, because the YouTube website itself is accessible to screen readers. I suggest we do that. Or, if nothing else, we need more copy on the live pairing page to explain what is there. Right now there isn't enough context for what is on the page if a person can't see it.

freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,111,more verbose bonfire challenge descriptions,"At times, the bonfire challenge descriptions do not always give a clear expectation of what the test cases are looking for. The test cases are sometimes visible when the programmer tries to run a program, but not always clearly written out from a user standpoint.
Example: ""Where do I belong?""
""Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into a sorted array (first argument).""
The test cases that are visible after submitting code are:
""assert.equal(indexForNum, 3, '35 should be inserted at index 3');""
assert.equal(indexFor30, 2, '30 should be inserted at index 2');
While the test cases obviously work from a functionality standpoint, what is visible to the user is not always clear. What are indexforNum and then indexfor30?
The description of the problem, visible upon load, could simply add,
""[[2,4,6,8], 7] should return 3""
If the lack of verbose instructions is part of the challenge, then it doesn't need changed; on the other hand, being a bit more explicit about the spec of a particular problem seems more ""real-life"" and could be helpful.
I am willing to add this feature myself, but only if it doesn't conflict with the intent and purpose of the bonfire challenges. :)",2015-02-21T23:23:49Z,1,2015-02-22T04:44:16Z,3

freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,115,FCC points and achievement dates wrongfully reset upon clicking challenge completion,"Action Performed:
1: Passed a bonfire challenge and changed point total from 55 to 56.
2. Went to profile and click on challenge 3.
3. Marked challenge 3 as completed. - Challenge 3 has already been completed.
4. Saw point total go back to 55 and saw challenge 3 finish date set to 2/23/2015.
Expected Result:
Point total should remain at 56 and challenge 3 finish date should remain at the original date.
Actual Result:
Point total reverted to 55 and challenge 3 finish date set to erroneous date.
Notes
Thankfully, bonfire completion is not reset.

Use of IO.js would be awesome here as it would mean being able to use es6 features, newest version of Googles V8, and not to mention all the bug patches that come with that.
The downside here would be for new users trying to learn by running the site here. This could potentially raise the barrier to use here. There are great options for switching between Node and IO.js(n and nvm both support switching), and All node scripts will run in IO.js (for the most part).
@QuincyLarson I think this would be a great addition code-wise, but I understand one the reasons for this code base is to allow new Campers to play with the site. I just wanted to put it out there.

freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,158,"Clarification on ""Map the Debris"" Bonfire","Link to Bonfire

By ""Sputkin"" do they mean ""Sputnik""? If it is really Sputnik, the Wikipedia article for Sputnik1 says that its semi-major axis was about 6500 km.
What are the units involved? Looking at the test case for the Moon: {name: ""moon"", orbitalPeriod: 2377399}, if the Orbital Period is in seconds, then that is 2377399 / (60 * 24 * 60) = 27.52 days. If the GM constant provided by the problem is also in units of km^3/s^2 (as in Wikipedia), than this would be so. (EDIT: I left out an extra 7 in that calculation).

If the purpose is to get the solver to use the Math object methods (PI, pow, etc.) and maybe the map method, it might be better to just provide an explicit formula, since I don't think I'm applying the information from Wikipedia correctly.",2015-03-07T21:53:51Z,1,2015-03-07T22:11:11Z,2

We can explain that the Dash challenges are presented as image slides (accessibility FAIL), but that our community has transcribed the slides for easier use in screen readers. link to Dash transcriptions
We can also share that for any blind person needing extra assistance with the CSS challenges, that our community is more than willing to help by confirming the visual look or otherwise.\n\n##Did you find an accessibility issue?
Offer the recommended action(s) to take when someone runs into an accessibility issue. Should the camper share this in one of the chat rooms, via Github issues, or email?

Add list item to Challenge 0 that provides accessibility link for campers in need.
This is the first message that openly welcomes everyone with accessibility challenges.

Create page for all Dash challenges
Right now these challenges have been shared with our one known blind camper via gists. I'm assuming there is a better way that we could present these. Any suggestions?

Also, could the challenges that are still needed be added to the challenge pages as extra credit? It is a lot easier to type this text up as someone is taking the challenge, as opposed to spending 30 minutes to 1 hour typing otherwise (much of that time is spent clicking between slides and such). ESOComputing said it didn't add much time when she was doing it this way. *

Make Challenge Checklist Accessible
Currently, the button that lists all challenges is not accessible. The list itself is fine, but the mechanism of strikethrough on completed challenges does not show up on screen readers. Basically, all challenges ""look"" the same whether they have been completed or not.
A quick bandaid for this would be to at least add challenge numbers to the user profiles page. Right now, challenges are listed without challenge number. If they are listed with number, a visually-impaired user could check for unfinished challenges by number and go to the challenge list to find them.
Ideally, I think the challenge completion list needs to be a checkbox form.",2015-03-08T05:43:46Z,1,2015-03-29T23:32:29Z,0

freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,218,Design Flaw in Bonfires ,"When you click on Run Code in a Bonfire challenges with just the default code, it shows you all the tests that are run for that program and their expected output. This can be used to write a program that returns the expected output for all the tests and pass the challenge.
I passed the No Repeats Please challenge by doing just this. Here is my code :
function permAlone(str) {
  if(str == 'aab')
    return 2;
  if(str == 'abcdefa')
    return 3600;
  if(str == 'abfdefa')
    return 2640;
  if(str == 'zzzzzzzz')
    return 0;
  if(str == 'aabb')
    return 8;
  if(str == 'aaa')
    return 0;
}


My solution for this design flaw is, instead of giving away the expected output, we say something like ""Your code din't pass for this test"" and give just the input of the test and not the expected output.
That way the user would not know what the expected outputs are and would not be able to pass the challenge like I did.",2015-03-17T20:53:05Z,1,2015-03-17T21:38:28Z,2

freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,224,Unknown Windows/connect-mongo bug,"When running the gulp command, the browser launches and I get an error:

500 Error: Error getting collection: sessions
at \freecodecamp\node_modules\connect-mongo\lib\connect-mongo.js:160:19

Refreshing ""fixes"" the problem. If gulp auto reloads the project it's also fine. If I rerun the ""gulp"" command the error happens again.
What it looks like is happening is the browser is being launched before the following is actually ready:
app.use(session({
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: true,
    secret: secrets.sessionSecret,
    store: new MongoStore({
        url: secrets.db,
        'auto_reconnect': true
    })
}));
MongoStore has a callback and If I move the following code into it, the problem is fixed:
/**
 * Start Express server.
 */
app.listen(app.get('port'), function () {
    console.log(
        'FreeCodeCamp server listening on port %d in %s mode',

freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,261,Error handlers needed,"These files need eror handling.
Proper handling tips:

end early
use next as callback in express middleware
If there are multiple asynchronous functions, such as database queries, they must either be nested or use promise chains to resolve, preferably promises.

End Early
Whenever an error exist in express middleware, the callback function should be ended by returning the callback call with err as the first argument. What does that mean?
Down below is an example of what a proper error handling express route should look like. Notice how the function being passed into app.use method as the second argument has three parameters. This is a standard pattern in express to signify to express two things:

this is handler is what is called a middleware
if next, the callback for the route handler, is called by us, the camper-developer extraordinaire, with an argument, an error has occurred and needs to be handled by the error handler down the road.

app.use('/some-end-point', function(req, res, next) {
  // some really cool code happens here <<<<
  // then an async call below. Notice the callback being passed into the save method
  User.save(function (err) {
    // the save method must call the database. Lots of things can go wrong here, so if the driver that connects to the database detects something bad it will call this function that we pass into it with the error it detects. We now need to be responsible campers and deal with this error.
    if (err) {
      // if we get to this point that means `err` exists and we need to end this function and call the callback.
      return next(err);
    }
    // because of the return in the conditional above, if we reach the code below that means the database returned with no errors. Now we can proceed.
   res.send('stuff happend, saved user, end of line');
   // it is important to end the route handler in two ways. Either by calling `next` with or without an err argument. This will tell express to look for the next route handler. The other way is to send something down to the user using a `res` method. `res` here is short for response meaning the response to the user. Most of the time you will be using `res.render` but you could also call `res.end` to not send the user anything other than a message that says the request to the server has ended. 
  });
});

Most of the projects included within the lessons are simple checklists with very unclear instructions that throw jargon around that isn't properly explained. It also barely explains what MVC frameworks are, something very important for learning why to use Angular.
I suggest replacing the lessons with the similar (and similarly free) Angular offering from CodeSchool called 'Shaping Up With Angular.js'. This is a much more step-by-step walkthrough of Angular that shows in detail how to use Angular to build a very nice app.",2015-04-29T03:02:24Z,1,2015-04-29T12:49:16Z,5

freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,397,Inconsistent dasherization,"First: the zipline title Zipline: Stylize Stories on Camper News dasherizes as zipline:-stylize-stories-on-camper-news. Note the dash after colon. However the story on camper news AppMachine: Make an app within hours. - AppMachine dasherizes as appmachine-make-an-app-within-hours--appmachine. No dash after colon and a confusing double-dash at the end, which brings us to...
Second: one of the requirements of the zipline is to make a link to the story discussion page. In the json that http://www.freecodecamp.com/stories/hotStories returns there is a property storyLink and for the AppMachine story the value is appmachine make an app within hours appmachine.  If I were to turn all spaces into dashes I would get appmachine-make-an-app-within-hours-appmachine, which is incorrect (remember the double-dash?).
I think the only way to link back to the page from json is to dasherize the headline, which is more difficult to do and probably not intended (otherwise, why include storyLink?)
What do you think the proper dasherization algorithm is? Maybe we should just delete all punctuation, trim the string and replace all whitespace with single dashes?",2015-04-30T13:44:04Z,1,2015-05-26T07:37:06Z,2

send.type = req.query.type;

It seems that Sum Of All Prime validator is messed up. It is taking the answer generated by submissions and doubling it.
I am getting the error below:
expect(sumPrimes(10)).to.equal(17);expected 34 to equal 17
17 should be the correct answer.
Here is my code:
var primes = [];
var primeSum = 0;

function sumPrimes(num) {
  for (var i=0; i<=num; i++) {

    if (i>11) {
      var j=0;
      for ( j=0; j<primes.length; j++) {
        if ((i % primes[j]) === 0) {
          break;
        }
      }

      if (j==primes.length) {

      }

    } else {
      if (i===2 || i===3 || i===5 || i===7 || i==11) {

Use twitter for signing

FCC shows default camper image for user image


post link to camper news


Camper news uses user image url, which at this point is broken


Update image url to new twitter image url


User image is updated
Camper news image is not updated, still broken.


possible solutions:

When posting link, ping user image and look for 200 code, if positive use image, else use default image. (only checks once, only slows down link posting)
When rendering camper news pull image url from user. (this would be costly and would slow down rendering)",2015-05-25T00:28:41Z,1,2015-08-11T16:06:40Z,3

freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,485,Waypoint 40: Manage Packages with NPM tweaks,"Summary of recommendations:

Recommend changing step 11 of Waypoint 40 to drop sudo.
Recommend adding two notes on possible bugs in parts 08 and 09 of how-to-npm.

Tweak step 11

Run this command: npm install how-to-npm -g

I ran simultaneous workspaces, installing how-to-npm with and without sudo. With sudo, you needed to sudo all of the things, which shouldn't be necessary, and some things didn't work as expected even then.
(Ex.: Part 13, Outdated. npm outdated produces no result, so campers would have to guess the outdated package or ask how-to-npm to reveal the answer.)
Without sudo nearly everything works as expected with two minor bugs:
Notes to be added

In part 08 Publish, how-to-npm forgot about me and npm adduser was of no use. But if you return to part 02 and run npm adduser again (or its alias 'npm login') and verify, then return to part 08, you can proceed.
In part 09 Version, npm version is supposed to automatically update your package.json but it doesn’t. You have to manually edit the version number in your package.json before you can verify and continue.

Aside from that, everything else works, and you don't have to sudo anything.",2015-05-26T05:25:01Z,1,2015-05-26T07:36:50Z,0
